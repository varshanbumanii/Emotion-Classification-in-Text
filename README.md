### Emotion Classification in Text
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project for detecting emotions in user-generated text.

Built an emotion classifier using NLP techniques and machine learning models to detect emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, and neutrality from input text.

Preprocessed data using tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.

Trained and evaluated models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, achieving over 85% accuracy on a balanced dataset.

Visualized results using confusion matrices and emotion distribution charts.

Deployed the model using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface to input text and view real-time emotion predictions.
